NAME         top
       sys/stat.h — data returned by the stat() function
SYNOPSIS         top
       #include <sys/stat.h>
DESCRIPTION         top
       The <sys/stat.h> header shall define the structure of the data
       returned by the fstat(), lstat(), and stat() functions.

       The <sys/stat.h> header shall define the stat structure, which
       shall include at least the following members:

           dev_t st_dev            Device ID of device containing file.
           ino_t st_ino            File serial number.
           mode_t st_mode          Mode of file (see below).
           nlink_t st_nlink        Number of hard links to the file.
           uid_t st_uid            User ID of file.
           gid_t st_gid            Group ID of file.
           dev_t st_rdev           Device ID (if file is character or block special).
           off_t st_size           For regular files, the file size in bytes.
                                   For symbolic links, the length in bytes of the
                                   pathname contained in the symbolic link.
                                   For a shared memory object, the length in bytes.
                                   For a typed memory object, the length in bytes.
                                   For other file types, the use of this field is
                                   unspecified.
           struct timespec st_atim Last data access timestamp.
           struct timespec st_mtim Last data modification timestamp.
           struct timespec st_ctim Last file status change timestamp.
           blksize_t st_blksize    A file system-specific preferred I/O block size
                                   for this object. In some file system types, this
                                   may vary from file to file.
           blkcnt_t st_blocks      Number of blocks allocated for this object.

       The st_ino and st_dev fields taken together uniquely identify the
       file within the system.

       The <sys/stat.h> header shall define the blkcnt_t, blksize_t,
       dev_t, ino_t, mode_t, nlink_t, uid_t, gid_t, off_t, and time_t
       types as described in <sys/types.h>.

       The <sys/stat.h> header shall define the timespec structure as
       described in <time.h>.  Times shall be given in seconds since the
       Epoch.

       Which structure members have meaningful values depends on the
       type of file. For further information, see the descriptions of
       fstat(), lstat(), and stat() in the System Interfaces volume of
       POSIX.1‐2017.

       For compatibility with earlier versions of this standard, the
       st_atime macro shall be defined with the value st_atim.tv_sec.
       Similarly, st_ctime and st_mtime shall be defined as macros with
       the values st_ctim.tv_sec and st_mtim.tv_sec, respectively.

       The <sys/stat.h> header shall define the following symbolic
       constants for the file types encoded in type mode_t.  The values
       shall be suitable for use in #if preprocessing directives:

       S_IFMT      Type of file.

                   S_IFBLK     Block special.

                   S_IFCHR     Character special.

                   S_IFIFO     FIFO special.

                   S_IFREG     Regular.

                   S_IFDIR     Directory.

                   S_IFLNK     Symbolic link.

                   S_IFSOCK    Socket.

       The <sys/stat.h> header shall define the following symbolic
       constants for the file mode bits encoded in type mode_t, with the
       indicated numeric values. These macros shall expand to an
       expression which has a type that allows them to be used, either
       singly or OR'ed together, as the third argument to open() without
       the need for a mode_t cast. The values shall be suitable for use
       in #if preprocessing directives.

       The following macros shall be provided to test whether a file is
       of the specified type. The value m supplied to the macros is the
       value of st_mode from a stat structure. The macro shall evaluate
       to a non-zero value if the test is true; 0 if the test is false.

       S_ISBLK(m)    Test for a block special file.

       S_ISCHR(m)    Test for a character special file.

       S_ISDIR(m)    Test for a directory.

       S_ISFIFO(m)   Test for a pipe or FIFO special file.

       S_ISLNK(m)    Test for a symbolic link.

       S_ISSOCK(m)   Test for a socket.

       The implementation may implement message queues, semaphores, or
       shared memory objects as distinct file types. The following
       macros shall be provided to test whether a file is of the
       specified type. The value of the buf argument supplied to the
       macros is a pointer to a stat structure. The macro shall evaluate
       to a non-zero value if the specified object is implemented as a
       distinct file type and the specified file type is contained in
       the stat structure referenced by buf.  Otherwise, the macro shall
       evaluate to zero.

                     Test for a shared memory object.

       The implementation may implement typed memory objects as distinct
       file types, and the following macro shall test whether a file is
       of the specified type. The value of the buf argument supplied to
       the macros is a pointer to a stat structure. The macro shall
       evaluate to a non-zero value if the specified object is
       implemented as a distinct file type and the specified file type
       is contained in the stat structure referenced by buf.  Otherwise,
       the macro shall evaluate to zero.

       The <sys/stat.h> header shall define the following symbolic
       constants as distinct integer values outside of the range
       [0,999999999], for use with the futimens() and utimensat()
       functions: UTIME_NOW UTIME_OMIT

       The following shall be declared as functions and may also be
       defined as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.

           int    chmod(const char *, mode_t);
           int    fchmod(int, mode_t);
           int    fchmodat(int, const char *, mode_t, int);
           int    fstat(int, struct stat *);
           int    fstatat(int, const char *restrict, struct stat *restrict, int);
           int    futimens(int, const struct timespec [2]);
           int    lstat(const char *restrict, struct stat *restrict);
           int    mkdir(const char *, mode_t);
           int    mkdirat(int, const char *, mode_t);
           int    mkfifo(const char *, mode_t);
           int    mkfifoat(int, const char *, mode_t);
           int    mknod(const char *, mode_t, dev_t);
           int    mknodat(int, const char *, mode_t, dev_t);
           int    stat(const char *restrict, struct stat *restrict);
           mode_t umask(mode_t);
           int    utimensat(int, const char *, const struct timespec [2], int);

       Inclusion of the <sys/stat.h> header may make visible all symbols
       from the <time.h> header.

       The following sections are informative.
APPLICATION USAGE         top
       Use of the macros is recommended for determining the type of a
       file.
RATIONALE         top
       A conforming C-language application must include <sys/stat.h> for
       functions that have arguments or return values of type mode_t, so
       that symbolic values for that type can be used. An alternative
       would be to require that these constants are also defined by
       including <sys/types.h>.

       The S_ISUID and S_ISGID bits may be cleared on any write, not
       just on open(), as some historical implementations do.

       System calls that update the time entry fields in the stat
       structure must be documented by the implementors. POSIX-
       conforming systems should not update the time entry fields for
       functions listed in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017
       unless the standard requires that they do, except in the case of
       documented extensions to the standard.

       Upon assignment, file timestamps are immediately converted to the
       resolution of the file system by truncation (i.e., the recorded
       time can be older than the actual time). For example, if the file
       system resolution is 1 microsecond, then a conforming stat() must
       always return an st_mtim.tv_nsec that is a multiple of 1000. Some
       older implementations returned higher-resolution timestamps while
       the inode information was cached, and then spontaneously
       truncated the tv_nsec fields when they were stored to and
       retrieved from disk, but this behavior does not conform.

       Note that st_dev must be unique within a Local Area Network (LAN)
       in a ``system'' made up of multiple computers' file systems
       connected by a LAN.

       Networked implementations of a POSIX-conforming system must
       guarantee that all files visible within the file tree (including
       parts of the tree that may be remotely mounted from other
       machines on the network) on each individual processor are
       uniquely identified by the combination of the st_ino and st_dev
       fields.

       The unit for the st_blocks member of the stat structure is not
       defined within POSIX.1‐2008. In some implementations it is 512
       bytes. It may differ on a file system basis. There is no
       correlation between values of the st_blocks and st_blksize, and
       the f_bsize (from <sys/statvfs.h>) structure members.

       Traditionally, some implementations defined the multiplier for
       st_blocks in <sys/param.h> as the symbol DEV_BSIZE.

       Some earlier versions of this standard did not specify values for
       the file mode bit macros. The expectation was that some
       implementors might choose to use a different encoding for these
       bits than the traditional one, and that new applications would
       use symbolic file modes instead of numeric. This version of the
       standard specifies the traditional encoding, in recognition that
       nearly 20 years after the first publication of this standard
       numeric file modes are still in widespread use by application
       developers, and that all conforming implementations still use the
       traditional encoding.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS         top
       No new S_IFMT symbolic names for the file type values of mode_t
       will be defined by POSIX.1‐2008; if new file types are required,
       they will only be testable through S_ISxx() or S_TYPEISxxx()
       macros instead.
